            <h2>Bad Posture, Back Aches, Neck and Shoulder Strain</h2>
            <p>It’s an instantly recognisable silhouette: the figure hunched over a device. Pretty soon, that hunch is there even when the device isn’t. To make it worse, the back and shoulder muscles start complaining, too.
                An uncomfortable seat, a set-up with poor ergonomics, sitting too long or slouching lazily — these all contribute to the problem.
                Laptop computers can aggravate things because the monitor and keyboard are so close. Users either lift their shoulders to type, or hunch their shoulders to see.</p>

            <h2>Blue Light Exposure</h2>
            <p>Anything more than the recommended level is considered excessive screen time can be a reason for headaches, blurry vision, and social anxiety. However, there are many more symptoms which is a result of excessive screen time and can be the root cause of many lifestyle diseases in the later stages of life, like thyroid, PCOD, and sleep paralysis.</p>

            <h2>Headaches</h2>
            <p>Children seldom get headaches, but too much screen-time can bring one on.
             A combination of muscle tension at the base of the skull and an assault on the eyes is the usual cause, as well as stress..</p>

        <section class="cause">
            <h2>Physical Fatigue</h2>
            <p>Too much time on a device doesn’t just drain the brain, it tires the body, too.
                Being still for long periods reduces blood circulation and can put stress on muscles and joints. The result — getting tired without even moving much.</p>

        <section class="cause">
            <h2>Poor Sleep Patterns</h2>
            <p>Research has confirmed exposure to mobile phones and other devices can cause changes in brain activity and sleep disturbances. This could also be a stress symptom.</p>
