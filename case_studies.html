            <h2>Case Study 1: Excessive use of electronic gadgets: health effects</h2>
            <p>Mobile phones, internet, social networking sites, and texting have changed the way
                we see the world. There are ∼6.9 billion mobile users, almost as many as people on
                earth. People who excessively use electronic gadgets develop musculoskeletal
                disorders. Repetitive strain injury is a chronic condition that develops because of
                repetitive, forceful, or awkward hand movements for prolonged periods leading to
                damage to muscles, tendons, and nerves of the neck, shoulder, forearm, and hand,
                which can cause pain, weakness, numbness, or impairment of motor control. Eyes,
                neck muscles, arm, and wrist are affected with prolonged use of electronic gadgets.
                People who use smartphones excessively, because of their reduced amounts of
                face-to-face interaction, are likely to have a feeling that their social relationships are
                not supportive and rewarding and that they are not actively contributing to the
                happiness and well-being of others. The aim of this review article is to study
                literature and list the problems associated with prolonged use of electronic gadgets
                and ways to minimize the symptoms owing to increased ‘screen time’. Smartphone
                overuse may lead to development of repetitive stress injury or overuse syndrome
                thereby affecting hand function resulting in pain in the thumb. Prolonged use of
                electronic gadgets may affect the human body adversely. There is a critical need to
                promote healthy ways of smartphone use, as well as the importance of friendship
                and family connectedness as a way of promoting the psychological well-being.
                Physicians should get themselves updated of these new disorders and younger
                generation needs to be educated adequately about the ergonomic practices and
                health safety of gadget usage.</p>

            <h2>Case Study 2: Harmful effects of gadget use on individuals</h2>
            <p>Recent statistics find that mobile phone users check their phones 81 times a day and spend an average of 4.9 hours on the device daily. [1] Younger users, particularly those born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s who are more commonly referred to as the Gen-Z population, spend nearly 16 hours on gadgets a day [2]. In the current technology-driven world, however, mobile phones are but one of the many electronic gadgets that aid, guide, and, sometimes, dictate human life. An electronic gadget is a device that has practical uses and is often intended to make activities easier [3]. From laptops and video games to kitchen appliances and digital cameras, gadgets have become commonplace in our lives. 

                While electronic gadgets have made life easier for the human population, their unchecked use is linked to several health issues, both physiological and psychological. For instance, instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp have reinvented the domain of communication by enabling quick communication with people no matter their geographical location. However, over-dependence on such messaging applications often lead people to experience mental distress when away from their phone. Moreover, constant engagement on these applications, while sitting in awkward positions, can cause severe musculoskeletal issues, such as shoulder pains, due to improper posture. [4] That the seemingly innocuous activity of text messaging has such potential side effects indicates the need to closely evaluate the detrimental effects that gadget use can have on a person’s health. This post seeks to catalog and examine these effects in some detail. 
                
                Gadget addiction 
                
                The widespread availability and use of electronic gadgets is advantageous in several ways. Be it smartwatches that help one track health metrics or e-readers that allow one to read any book anywhere, there are many gadgets that make mundane activities, like exercise, fun and easier. [5] Unlike the age when mobile phones were devices that merely facilitated verbal conversations, today the mobile phone hosts a variety of applications that can perform a multitude of tasks, making it one of the most valued and overused gadgets of all. However, as with most products or devices involving technology, excessive use of electronic gadgets can lead to serious health concerns, most of which stem from the primary condition that is gadget addiction.
                
                Gadget addiction refers to the state where a person indulges in excessive use of gadgets to the point that it has detrimental effects on their health and well-being. [6]  There are four major stages contributing to developing a gadget addition: trigger, action, reward, and investment. [7] Trigger can refer to any factor that prompts one to use their gadget, ranging from boredom to curiosity. Once triggered, persons act on the trigger by using the particular gadget; most often this manifests as browsing or scrolling through social media platforms or web pages. The action is rewarded by the content the user comes across, which is, often invariably, fun, intriguing, and captivating, be it YouTube videos, PlayStation games, or Netflix series. This reward keeps users coming back to the gadget, thereby, securing an investment of time and attention from the user. [8] It may not be the case that all persons who excessively use gadgets develop an addiction for these devices but given the fact that most activities today, including working and studying, require the use of gadgets, it is easy to develop one, possibly without even realizing it. </p>

            <h2>Case Study 3: Posture Correction Wearable</h2>
            <p>posture monitoring aiming at preventing many of the pathologies affecting the spine is becoming more and more essential in many contexts, including telemedicine. The market pushes towards the development of new technical solutions that are comfortable for the user and that are increasingly becoming lower in terms of cost. Some systems at the state of the art level are effective and sometimes quite comfortable, but they have a degree of complexity that is not compatible with some market segments. Here, we report on the development, at a prototype level, a simple, low-cost, and potentially very comfortable microcontroller-based system capable of signaling incorrect postures with great sensitivity. The prototype, which has been tested also using video analysis, has shown its capacity to be easily integrated into a garment. Experimental activity has proven the prototype’s functionality. The wearable embedded system is able to detect flections in the back region monitored by the flex sensor with an accuracy of <3°. The achievement represents a further demonstration of the potential of wearable electronics in the context of cyber-physical systems for healthcare.</p>

            <h2>Case Study 3: Time Management App</h2>
            <p>The usage of mobile devices has been steadily increasing, with the average time spent on mobile devices exceeding 4.5 hours per day in 2022, leading to negative impacts on users' health. In response to this issue, the REMINDEE project was developed to create a mobile app using Flutter that promotes regular breaks from screen time. The app encourages users to take short breaks, following the 20-20-20 rule, which involves looking away from the screen every 20 minutes, for 20 seconds, at an object that is 20 feet away. During break time, the app blocks all actions on the device, ensuring that the user cannot continue using the device. The project aims to reduce screen time and encourage users to take regular breaks, which can help reduce eye strain, prevent headaches, and improve overall health. The app also allows users to customize their break time, set reminders, and view their usage statistics to help monitor their progress. Ultimately, the REMINDEE project aims to promote healthy screen time habits, allowing users to maintain their health and well-being while still staying connected to their devices.</p>
